Idea: How about taking leading spaces in Python code and moving them to the end of each line? A bad one, right (especially considering that they have an important meaning in Python code)? Well, it is, but here it is anyway.

This is a very simple prototype of an interpreter that runs python code where all indentations are moved to the end (which makes it pretty much unreadable).

Might be good as an April Fools' joke, I guess...
